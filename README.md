1. Video Summarization using AI (Layman Explanation)
What does this do?

Imagine you have a long video or podcast episode, and you want to know what it’s about without watching the whole thing. This tool does three smart things:

Pulls out the audio from your video.

Turns the spoken words into written text (like subtitles or a transcript).

Summarizes that text into just a few key points so you can read a quick summary instead of listening to the whole thing.

How does it help Kuku FM?

It helps users save time. Instead of playing every episode to find what they like, they can just read the summary and decide quickly if it’s interesting. This makes the app more user-friendly and keeps people coming back.

🤖 2. Chatbot that Recommends Series/Movies (Layman Explanation)
What does this do?

This is like a smart chat friend that listens to what kind of content you like — for example, you might say:

“I enjoy emotional drama with time travel”

Based on your message, it finds similar shows or podcasts that match your taste using smart math behind the scenes. It understands what you're looking for and shows you a few suggestions.

How does it help Kuku FM?

Instead of making users scroll through hundreds of episodes, the chatbot makes it easy and fun to find something they’ll like — which keeps them happy, helps them discover new content, and makes them stay longer in the app.
